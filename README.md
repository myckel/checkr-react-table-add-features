# WebFeatureAddReact Challenge - Enhanced Solution

This repository contains my proposed solution for the WebFeatureAddReact challenge. The base project is a React application which fetches an array of countries data via HTTP and displays part of this data in a table. I have enhanced this table with a number of additional features.

## Added Features

In response to the requirements, the following features have been added:

- Filtering: Implemented filtering options that allow users to filter the data by one or multiple columns.
- Sorting: Users can now sort the data by one or more columns.
- Pagination: Added a pagination feature which can be modified to show a specified number of records at a time.

In addition to the required features, I have also implemented the following enhancements:

- Column Reordering: Users can now reorder the columns of the table according to their preferences.
- Data Refresh: Added a button to refresh the data.
- Clear Filter: Users can easily clear all applied filters with a single click.
- LocalStorage: The state of filters, sorting, and column order are preserved in local storage. This means that users will find the table in the same state they left it, even after refreshing or reopening the page.

# Final Remarks

I hope this enhanced solution meets your expectations. I endeavored to add not only the required functionalities but also some user-friendly features to improve the overall user experience. Your feedback is highly appreciated. Thank you for considering my submission.
